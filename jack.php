			<p> Welcome to a small bio page about me (Jack) and my various things I like to do. Outside of my majors (Math and Computer Science), I enjoy passing the time with some of my favorite hobbies. These hobbies include art, cello, and fishing. Scroll down to learn more about me.  </p>

				<h2> Art </h2>
				<p> For many years as a child, I took art lessons, and recently for the past two years over the summer, I have taught art lessons at studios near me. I enjoy painting the most and more specifically I like watercolor and acrylic. Many of my favorite things to paint include landscapes and still life.   </p>

				<h2> Cello </h2>
				<p> I have played cello for many years and enjoy listening to classical music. Wanting to continue playing cello on a consistent basis during college, I joined the University's Chamber Orchestra and have met people who appreciate classical as much as I do. I have even joined a small string ensemble with a few friends for the upcoming semester. </p>

				<h2> Fishing </h2>
				<p> I love to go fishing in the ponds around my home, as well as exploring new waters when I am traveling. I am drawn to the unpredicatability of fishing and the adventure of exploring new areas I have never fished before. Fishing has taught me a lot about patience and persistence. The feeling of fighting a large fish never gets old.    </p>
