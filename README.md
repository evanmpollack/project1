Project 1: Team “Flash” Website

TODO:

The final product of this assignment must meet the following requirements:

  The entire team must use a GitHub repository
    
    Technician: setup the repo and make sure everyone can sync it to their desktop (using GitHub desktop software)--DONE
    
    Technician: create four “stubs” - four empty HTML webpages with the proper HTML5 structure and no content. (The IA will fill-in the content next.)--DONE

  Each one of the three students’ initial personal websites from Lab 1 must be refactored into single webpages (four pages into one long scrolly page) and then combined to         create   a three page website plus a new index page (four webpages, total)
    
    IA: organize the content into the webpage “stubs” created by the Technician
    
    IA: ensure that the document structure (article, aside, whatever) is consistent on each student-page; and ensure that the document outline (h1, h2, et cetera) is somewhat       consistent on each student-page …note: it won’t be, but you have to make it so!
      
      Take liberties with the content as you see fit.
     
     *Note: if you’re working with content that had an HTML form, you can throw that out.
    
    IA: create some content for the new home page.
  
      You can fashion it like Project 3 from CSC 170 using snippets from the sub-pages to create           “wells” (sections) with embedded links to the sub-pages …or something like that. It’s up             to you.
  
  There must be a new menu system

    IA: code the navigation and make sure it works so you can go from page to page easily.
    Note: you don’t have to install it in PHP Includes if the Technician didn’t already set it up for     you, and you don’t have to style it nor make the current page highlighter work.
  
    IA: there needs to be links back to the original Lab 1 websites in some appropriate place(s) …you     decide where
    
  There must a single look & feel for the entire website
  
    Visual Designer: the entire website must have a single set of styles that make the website look unified and cohesive, like any normal website
  
    *Hint: you can pick and choose from any of the designs, or even “steal” a design from any other Lab 1 website …it’s up to you
  
    *Warning: have the IA work on setting up the document structure and document outline first; then even if they’re still working on the content, you can start the design process when those things are (mostly) nailed down, or if the IA hasn’t fleshed-out the content yet, you can use lorem ipsum content and FPO-images as needed that the IA can replace later.

The HTML, CSS and JS code, files and file system must be clean and follow industry best practices and standards (note: “industry best practices” includes the use of PHP          Includes as appropriate)

    Technician: make sure the entire website works normally/correctly, and make sure all the HTML and CSS pass W3C validation (within reason); also make sure the website is optimized and all file and folder names are correct.
