			<p>I've always been in close proximity to music, mainly due to my dad's career in the musical world. I most closely relate to rock music and the electric guitar, having listened to various rock genres and bands since I was young. I most fondly recall listening to Jimi Hendrix in my dad's car. At the time, I had no regard for what I was listening to, but as I grew up I developed a great appreciation for Hendrix and music in general.</p>
			<p>Now, I'm always with a guitar, practicing on the daily. I play in the Rock Ensemble at school, take Jazz guitar lessons at the Eastman School of Music, and have begun recording and mixing my guitar playing. I hope to begin writing my own songs one day. </p>
