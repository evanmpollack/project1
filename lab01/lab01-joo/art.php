			<p>I've always had great interest in art and design. One of my favorite things to do is go to museums and galleries. To keep my interest in art alive, I took a course on printmaking last semester. This was the first time I did printmaking, and it was a lot of fun.</p>
			<p>&lt;-- This is was my first work, titled <strong><em>Symbiosis</em></strong></p>
			<p>Linoleum blocks were carved, inked, and pressed onto the paper. This technique is called relief printing.</p>
			<p>This piece was inspired by M.C. Escher's work. This type of pattern is called a tessellation.</p>
