			<p>This is a page about me. I am from South Korea, and was born and raised there my entire life. I'm fluent in both English and Korean (and speak a bit of French)! I'm going talk about some of the things I like.</p>
			<p>I like doing art. To learn more about some of my work, go to the <a href="art.php"><em>Art</em></a> page. If you want to learn more about the music I like, go to the <a href="music.php"><em>Music</em></a> page. I also have a cat. Go to the <a href="cat.php"><em>My Cat</em></a> page to see pictures of my cat.</p>
