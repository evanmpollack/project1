        <h2>XC & Track</h2>

        <p>I started running cross country in 6th grade. In middle school XC, I competed on courses
            roughly 2 miles long. In 7th grade, I started running track, where I
            mainly competed in the 1600m (~1mi) until high school. In high school XC, I competed in
            the 5k, where by junior year I was in the top 50 high school runners in the state
            (Section 3A). In indoor/outdoor track, I moved up to the 3200m (~2mi), where by junior year I was
            consistently in the top 15 in my county. The success in high school landed me a spot on
            UR's XC and indoor/outdoor track teams. Unfortunately, I got a stress fracture in my foot
            during my first collegiate indoor track season. After a lot of reflection, I decided to
            end my running career because I liked the life I had without the pressure of running.</p>
