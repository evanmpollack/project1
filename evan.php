				<h3> Summary </h3>

				</figure>

				<p>I am a student at the University of Rochester, which is located in Rochester, NY. My major is undecided, but I plan on minoring in computer science. I grew
	            up in the Washington D.C. area. I have been involved in activities such as
	            running competitively and snowboarding. </p>

					<h3> Early Life </h3>
					<p>I was born in Washington D.C. but have always lived in Maryland with my parents
			        and two younger brothers, who are twins. I attended Rosemary Hills Elementary
			        School, Barrie School, and James Hubert Blake High School.</p>

					<h3> XC & Track </h3>
					<p>I started running cross country in 6th grade. In middle school XC, I competed on courses roughly 2 miles long. In 7th grade, I started running track, where I
		            mainly competed in the 1600m (~1mi) until high school. In high school XC, I competed in the 5k, where by junior year I was in the top 50 high school runners in the state (Section 3A). In indoor/outdoor track, I moved up to the 3200m (~2mi), where by junior year I was consistently in the top 15 in my county. The success in high school landed me a spot on UR's XC and indoor/outdoor track teams. Unfortunately, I got a stress fracture in my foot during my first collegiate indoor track season. After a lot of reflection, I decided to end my running career because I liked the life I had without the pressure of running.</p>

					<h3>Snowboarding </h3>
					<p>In 7th grade, I joined the Gaithersburg Ski and Snowboard Club. This club provided transportation to 2 local mountains, 8 times a season. I participated in this club every winter through 12th grade. Unfortunately, I've outgrown the club now that I'm in college. However, I still try to snowboard whenever possible.</p>
